Of the disposals above, MatsSoft Limited was realised in the prior year but proceeds were recognised in the current period in excess of the
amounts previously accrued.
The proceeds received in respect of MEL Topco Limited (t/a Maplin) reflected an interim distribution in respect of the company’s administration.
In addition to the above disposals, Steribottle Global Limited, which had a cost of £603,000 and a market value of £nil at 1 March 2018 was
dissolved in August 2018. No proceeds were received as part of the dissolution, however, the loss of £603,000 had already been recognised as
realised in the prior period.
